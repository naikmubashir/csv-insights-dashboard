# PROMPTS 

1. So far I have created a Next app and connected it with Vercel Prisma. Now build the actual functionality of this project present in project_spec.md. Use task.md for each sprint. Sprint 1 is done. Start Sprint 2 and only implement Sprint 2.

2. Read TASKS.md.
    Implement Sprint 3 only:
    - /api/analyze route
    - Gemini integration
    - System prompt
    - Loading states
    - Error handling
    - Display insights sections on upload page
    - Return structured JSON only.

3. Read PROJECT_SPEC.md.
    Implement Sprint 4 only:
    - Create Prisma model
    - /api/reports routes
    - Save report logic
    - Report detail page
    - History page (last 5 reports)
    - Follow schema exactly.

4. Read PROJECT_SPEC.md.
    Implement Sprint 5:
    - Copy to clipboard
    - Download as markdown
    - Status page
    - Health checks
    - Error boundaries
    - Loading & empty states

5. Implement column selection feature with checkbox UI and pass selected columns to /api/analyze.
